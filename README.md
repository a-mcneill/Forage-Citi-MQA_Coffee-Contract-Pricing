# Forage Citi Markets Quantitative Analysis Job Simulation: Coffee Contract Pricing Calculations

To build upon my foundational understanding of Python, I undertook Forage's Citi MQA job simulation, in which I was required to complete tasks that simulated the work of a Citi Quantitative Analyst.

As part of the job simulation, I calculated the fair price of a coffee option contract, including the futures price (cost of carry), the call option price (Black-Scholes formula), and the fair price via a Monte-Carlo simulation.

The purpose of this project was to continue my learning and development in Python programming, while also applying my professional experience and interest in financial markets to a Python project via a Forage virtual job simulation.

While I would typically define functions for these calculations and provide greater functionality to the program, this program was designed in alignment with the
requirements and layout provided in the virtual experience task documentation. As such, print statements have been used rather than the return values of functions.
